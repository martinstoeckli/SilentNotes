        Here we can define solution wide defines for conditional compiling. Write them semikolon
        delimited after $(DefineConstants) like this...

        ...but don't forget to reset this file before building for production. After changing a
        value, please rebuild the solution.
        
        Known defines are:
        ENV_PRODUCTION:  Has no effect (default)
        ENV_DEVELOPMENT: Uses different filenames for repository and settings (works only in DEBUG mode)
        LANG_EN:         Enforces an english localization (works only in DEBUG mode)
        LANG_DE:         Enforces a german localization (works only in DEBUG mode)
        DEMO:            Loads hard coded demo data (works only in DEBUG mode)
