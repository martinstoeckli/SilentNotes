## Security

Whenever an application promises security and confidentiality, users just have to trust the developer team. Not only is it challenging to do encryption right, users are more and more accustomed to pay with their personal data, to benefit from new technologies. We believe that the best way to build trust is to publish the entire source code, this is why SilentNotes was turned into an open source project.

## Credits

* The [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev)/[ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) editor made it possible to offer WYSIWYG note editing across platforms.
* Cryptograhic tasks are solved with the [Bouncy Castle](https://bouncycastle.org/) crypto API.
* The clean and minimalistic [Flurl](https://flurl.dev/) library helped a lot to keep the HTTP requests readable.
